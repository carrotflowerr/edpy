# edpy

This project is a remake of the GNU standard text editor known as 'ed.'

Historical editors such as ex, nano, and vi were birthed from ed. 

The goal of this project is to make a version of ed that you can configure.

edpy is hopefully just the blueprint to a c++ rewrite. For this to really feel like an editor it should be it's own binary.

See the to-do file for future plans.
